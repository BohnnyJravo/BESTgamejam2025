# Building Snowman
Project from **BEST Gamejam 2025**. \
**Theme**: Winter is coming

## Idea
Recently there has been less and less snow each year, specifically in central Europe. Due to that there is no way for us to enjoy building a snowman (or if there is enough snow it quickly melts). Therefore we made a game to let people enjoy building snowmen even when there isn't enough snow outside.

## Gameplay
With a, w, s, d player can move the snowball around. Snowball gathers snow from ground and keeps getting bigger. The goal is to gather enough snow on the ball to use it for a snowman. When enough is collected ball gets stored and new one is formed. When three are gathered along with at least 2 buttons and a carrot from the ground, a snowman can be made and points are received.

However there are things that should be avoided.

- Fireplaces will melt your ball if in its proximity long enough.

- We've all been warned about the yellow snow so it should be avoided. If you collect 3 yellow snow tiles you lose.

- Lastly if you hit any edge of the widow the ball gets destroyed on impact, but beware there are also some snow blizzards that will try their best to make you hit that edge.
